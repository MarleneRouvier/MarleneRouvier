- 👋 Hi, I’m @MarleneRouvier, front-end developer Jr. I have a very good level of English since I am an English Teacher.
- 👀 I’m interested in front-end development but I´m open to other alternatives.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Angular but after that I would like to learn any other JS framework such as React or Vue. I really like programming and I learn really fast! I have already learnt and worked in personal projects with HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 3 - 4 and 5 and JavaScript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a project, in which I could apply all my knowledge, improve my skills and learn from my peers.
