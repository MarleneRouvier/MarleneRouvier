- 👋 Hi, I’m @MarleneRouvier, front-end developer Jr. I have a very good level of English since I am an English Teacher.
- 👀 I’m interested in front-end development and I want to start learning any JS framework such as React, Angular or Vue. I really like programming and I learn really fast! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning JQuery in detail and I have already learnt and worked in personal projects with HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 3 - 4 and 5, JavaScript and JQuery.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a project, in which I could apply all my knowledge, improve my skills and learn from my peers.
