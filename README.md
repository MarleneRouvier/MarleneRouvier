- 👋 Hi, I’m @MarleneRouvier, Jr Adv Front-end developer. I have a very good level of English since I am an English Teacher too.
- 👀 I’m interested in front-end development because I love coding and designing new things as well as editing existing ones.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React. I have been learning and working with Angular during the last year but I love learning new things all the time. I really like programming and I learn really fast!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a project, in which I could apply all my knowledge as well as learn from others. This will help me improve my existing skills and learn new ones.
